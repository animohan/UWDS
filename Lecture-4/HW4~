Q1a.
The model is created and evaluated on the training data. The parameters of the model are tuned for getting higher accuracy on the training data. Hence it is expected that the model will work well on the training data. However, the test data is new and the model is not optimized for the test model. Therefore, the training model will always have lower error than test model.

Q1b.
The best way to partition the data is to randomize the rows of the dataframe and pick a subset for training.
The training set should be larger than test set so that the model can be trained with maximum available data

Q1c.
Run the model on both the dataset and compare the predicted results. Generally, the test data will have a higher error rate than the training data. 

Q2.
Training Data: 300: 149 ill and 151 healthy
Test Data: 100: 10 ill and 90 health
Prediction: 85 out of 90 healthy were predicted as healthy
	    5  out of 90 healthy folks were predicted
	    7 out 10 ill were predicted as ill
	    3 out of 10 ill were predictes as healhty
	    8 predictions were incorrect


			Actual (True/False)
	  	 	    ill 	Not-Ill
	  ill   	     7            3
Predicted
(+ve/-ve) Not-Ill	     5		  85

True Postive : 7
True Negative : 85
False Postive: 3
False Negative: 5

Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN) = 7/12
Specificity = TN/(TN+FP) = 85/(85+3)
Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) = 92/100
Precision = TP/(TP+FP) = 7/(7+3) 
Recall= TP/(TP+FN) = 7/(12)


Q3. 
a. Left end of the graph corresponds to threshold of 0
b. Right end of the graph corresponds to threshold of 1
c. We cannot directly see the exact point on ROC graph that corresponds to 0.5 threshold. But the point can be derived by calculations.

Q4. 
False Postive Rate: 0.4  
True Postive Rate: 0.8 
Accuracy: 0.7: 

False Positive Rate = FP/(FP + TN) = 0.4
True Positive Rate = TP/(TP + FN)  = 0.8
Accuracty = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)
TP + TN  = 700

				Actual 
			  
	  	 	    ill 	Not-Ill
 	  ill   	    TP  400      FP  200
Predicted
	 Not-Ill	    FN 	100	 TN  300

Cannot say what the probability threshold is.
